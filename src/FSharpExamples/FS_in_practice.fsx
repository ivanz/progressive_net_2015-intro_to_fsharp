“F# in practice”

In this session, we’ll have a look at the tooling around F#, including Visual Studio support, refactoring, etc. 

We’ll also look at best practices for integrating F# assemblies into an existing C# code base and tool-chain, 
and in particular, how easy it is to call C# code from F# and F# code from C#.

Also unit testing with NUnit.
